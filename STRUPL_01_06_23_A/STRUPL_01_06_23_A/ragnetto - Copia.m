% The parametric procedure(parameter ALFA is the positive scalar which 
% amplifies proportionally all load in the loading step delta t)describes 
% the finite step elastic plastic problem.  
% It is conisidered as given data the following vectors and matrix:scalar NY
% as the number of activable plastic modes, vector FIZERO(NY) (vector of the
% NY initial plastic potentials),matrix A(NY,NY), BI(NY) vector of the 
% elastic stresses due to the load increments during the step pojected 
% on the normal of the activable plastic modes 
% dei carichi nel passo proiettati sui modi plastici BI,

%               Parametric Linear Complementarity Problem
%
%             FI(t+delta t)= FI(t)+ A*delta Lambda-ALFA*BI 
%           FI >=0; delta Lambda>=0; (FI)t(delta Lambda)=0;
%
% Mechanical Remarks: 
%
% the above formulation will be able to solve:
% (i) the elastic-plastic-softening static holonomic problem both for a
% unique proportional loading condition and a sequence of proportional 
% loading stages, like for ciclic loadings. 
% (ii) the elastic plastic softening dinamic problem in which,
% at every time step,a proportional loading condition is solved.
% 
% First implementation will deal with the one step proportional static
% loading.
%
% Numerical aspects to be underlined:
% 
% (iii) Generally speaking, the first step of the PLCP coincides with 
% the solution of an LCP as:
%
%   FIdot=A*LAMBDAdot-BIdot; 
%   FIdot>=0; LAMBDAdot>=0;(FIdot)t*LAMBDAdot=0
%
% because vector FI(t) has some component equal to zero; 
%
% (iV) on the contrary, at the first step of the first proportional loading 
%      stage, vector FI(t)=R (vector of plastic reisstances) which can be
%      assumed all positive and therefore the PLCP can have a trivial first
%      step solution performing a simple pivot transformation by entering 
%      into the basis the load factor ALFA end exiting from the basis the 
%      first componebt of the vector FI which becomes equal to zero.
%
% PLCP can be described via a TABLEAU form trougth matrix TA which connects
% , at the starting procedure, variables FI (variables in the Basis) with
% parameter ALFA and variables LAMBDA.
%
% The rules are:
% 1. at each transformation (step), one non basic variable enters into the
%   Basis and one variable in the Basis goes out of the Basis;
% 2. the parameter ALFA increases until the problem is definite
%   positive;in special cases ALFA remains constant during a Tabeau
%   transformation (multiplicity of solutions at constant load);
%   in the case of undefinite problem ALFA decreases;
% 3. all variables are always positive or zero;
% 4.2 complementary (dual) variables satisfy always the ortogonality
%   condition FI(i)*LAMBDA(i)=0;
%
% Matrix TA(NY,NY+2) is made of NY rows and NY+2 columns. 
% First column contains the values of the in Basis variables; initially 
% it coincides with the initial values of vector FI=R >= 0.
% Second column it represents, initially, vector -BI corresponding to
% parameter ALFA out of Basis.
% All other columns coincide with the colums of matrix A.
% Basis variables are NY while Out of Basis variables are NY+1. 
%
% Parameter ALFA will enter into the Basis at first pivotal transformation
% and it will remain in Basis for the entire loading procedure.
% The loading procedure terminates when the prescribed value of ALFA 
% has been reached or because a limt load has been attained. In the case of
% softening behavior the procedure will stop when the laod has reach a
% local maximum; the procedure can restart to follow the descending path
% untill until the load multiplier ALFA has attained the prescribed
% decreased value or the problem has returned to be definite positive.
%
% Vectors LAMBDA and FI are updated at each pivotal transformation,
% together with the load factor ALFA.
% At each pivotal transformation one non basic varialble (=0) enters into
% the Basis (>0) and one basic variable (>0) goes out of the Basis
% (decoming =0).
% For the moment the assumption of "non degenenancy" is adopted, i.e. it is
% supposed that only one dual variables LAMBDA(i),FI(i) can be
% contemporaneausly =0.
% We know theat "degenerancy" of the solution will be abple to deal with
% multiplicity of solutions, i.e. with "equilibrium bifurcation points".
% At the first pivot transformation, variable ALFA enters into the Basis
% and a variable FI exit from the Basis; at the second transformation, we
% find out of the Basis one cople of dua vasiables, i.e. LAMBDA(i) and
% FI(i); therefore at the second transformation the LAMBDA(i) variable is
% going to enter into the Basis.
% Therefore the procedure assumes always as a general rule that the
% variable that is goint to enter into the Basis is the dual variable which
% has just exit from the Basis.
% In the Scientific Literature this rule is called "Restricted Basis rule".
% A part from particular situation( when the matrix A of the active modes
% become singular or undefined)the generic pivot transformation is
% represented by the following occurence:
% (i) one active mode (FI(i)=0 and LAMBDA(i)>0) become unactive, then first
% LAMBDA(i)becomes =0 and then FI(i) becomes>0, or
% (ii) one mode mode i unactive(i.e. FI(i)>0 and LAMBDA(i)=0) becomes
% active then first FI(i) becomes =0 and then LAMBDA(i) becomes >0.
%
% From the numerical point of view, in order tokeep track of the variables
% which are in the Basis and the variables which are out of the Basis at
% each Pivot Transformation, the fowwing vectors are created and updated at
% each pivot transformation:
% Column INB(i), with i=1,NY which list the code of the basic variables.
% The adopted code index is the following;
% code =0 corresponds to parameter ALFA;
% code 1 to NY list the variables FI(i);
% code NY+1 to 2NY list the variables LAMBDA8i).
% The codes of the non basic variables are listed in the row vector
% OUTB(1,1+NY).
